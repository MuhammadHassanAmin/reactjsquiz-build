This helps ensure fair usage and maintain server stability."},{"id":261,"question":"How can you implement rate limiting in API integration?","options":["By increasing the font size of text elements","By using query parameters like page and limit","By using authentication tokens","By using middleware or server-side logic to enforce request limits"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"You can implement rate limiting in API integration by using middleware or server-side logic to enforce request limits based on client identity or IP address. This allows you to control and manage the rate of incoming requests to ensure server stability."},{"id":262,"question":"What are some best practices for API integration in React Native?","options":["Hardcoding API keys in the client-side code","Using HTTPS for secure communication","Storing sensitive data in plain text","Exposing API endpoints without authentication"],"correctAnswer":"2","explanation":"Some best practices for API integration in React Native include using HTTPS for secure communication to protect sensitive data from interception or tampering. This helps ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the client and server."},{"id":263,"question":"What is the purpose of caching in API integration?","options":["To improve app performance","To prevent abuse and protect API servers from overload","To display loading indicators","To optimize network requests"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"Caching in API integration is used to improve app performance by storing frequently accessed data locally on the client device. This reduces the need for repeated network requests and speeds up data retrieval, resulting in a faster and more responsive user experience."},{"id":264,"question":"How can you implement caching in API integration?","options":["By increasing the font size of text elements","By using query parameters like page and limit","By storing API responses in local storage or AsyncStorage","By refreshing the entire app"],"correctAnswer":"3","explanation":"You can implement caching in API integration by storing API responses in local storage or AsyncStorage on the client device. This allows you to retrieve and reuse cached data without making additional network requests, improving app performance and reducing data usage."},{"id":265,"question":"What is the purpose of cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in API integration?","options":["To prevent abuse and protect API servers from overload","To improve app performance","To display loading indicators","To allow web applications hosted on different domains to access each other's resources"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in API integration is used to allow web applications hosted on different domains to access each other's resources securely. It enables controlled sharing of resources across different origins while preventing unauthorized access or data leakage."},{"id":266,"question":"How can you enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in API integration?","options":["By using authentication tokens","By allowing requests from specific origins using CORS headers","By caching API responses","By using query parameters like page and limit"],"correctAnswer":"2","explanation":"You can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in API integration by allowing requests from specific origins using CORS headers on the server side.
