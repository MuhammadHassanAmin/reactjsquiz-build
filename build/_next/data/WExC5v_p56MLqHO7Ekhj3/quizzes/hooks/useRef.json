It is specifically designed for referencing DOM elements."},{"id":"46","question":"What is the main benefit of using useRef for referencing DOM elements?","options":["It simplifies component logic","It automatically updates the DOM elements","It reduces memory consumption","It allows safe access and manipulation of DOM elements"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"The main benefit of using useRef for referencing DOM elements is that it allows safe access and manipulation of the underlying HTML elements, enhancing the interactivity and functionality of React components."},{"id":"47","question":"How does the useRef hook handle the initial value of the reference?","options":["It defaults to null","It requires an initial value to be specified","It defaults to an empty object","It throws an error"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"The useRef hook defaults to null for the initial value of the reference if no initial value is specified explicitly."},{"id":"48","question":"How can you use the useRef hook to manage focus in a React component?","options":["By attaching a ref to the focused element and using the useRef hook to track its focus state","By using the useRef hook to create a custom hook for managing focus","By passing the useRef hook as a prop to the focused element and updating its focus state externally","By using the useRef hook to create a separate focus management component"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"You can use the useRef hook to manage focus in a React component by attaching a ref to the focused element and using the useRef hook to track its focus state. This approach allows you to programmatically manage focus within your components."},{"id":"49","question":"Can the useRef hook be used to store and maintain mutable values between renders?","options":["Yes, useRef is suitable for storing mutable values","No, useRef is only for referencing DOM elements","It depends on the specific use case","Mutable values cannot be stored using useRef"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"Yes, the useRef hook can be used to store and maintain mutable values between renders, as it creates a mutable ref object that persists across re-renders of the component."}],"title":"useRef React Hook Quiz","description":"Quiz on react most used useRef hook."},"__N_SSG":true}
