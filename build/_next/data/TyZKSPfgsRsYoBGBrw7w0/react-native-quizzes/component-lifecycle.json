It allows you to synchronize state with props when props change, by returning an object to update the state."},{"id":240,"question":"What are lifecycle methods?","options":["Methods that control the lifecycle of a component","Methods that render JSX elements","Methods that update the component's state","Methods that handle component unmounting"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"Lifecycle methods in React Native are special methods that control the lifecycle of a component, from initialization to destruction. They allow you to hook into different points in the component's lifecycle and perform actions at those points."},{"id":241,"question":"How do you define lifecycle methods in React Native?","options":["By using class components","By using functional components","By using higher-order components","By using hooks"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"Lifecycle methods in React Native are defined in class components. They cannot be used in functional components, but functional components can utilize equivalent functionality with hooks like useEffect."},{"id":242,"question":"What happens when a component is unmounted in React Native?","options":["The component is removed from the DOM","The component's state is reset","The component's props are updated","The component is re-rendered"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"When a component is unmounted in React Native, it is removed from the DOM and its memory is freed up. This occurs when the component is no longer needed or when its parent component is re-rendered without it."},{"id":243,"question":"What are the different phases of the component lifecycle in React Native?","options":["Initialization, mounting, updating, unmounting","Rendering, updating, unmounting","Initialization, rendering, updating, unmounting","Mounting, updating, unmounting"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"The component lifecycle in React Native consists of four phases: initialization, mounting, updating, and unmounting. Each phase corresponds to a different stage in the component's lifespan and allows you to perform specific actions at those points."},{"id":244,"question":"What is the purpose of the componentWillMount method in React Native?","options":["To initialize state and bind event handlers","To render JSX elements","To update the component's state","To perform setup tasks before the component is mounted"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"The componentWillMount method in React Native is called just before the component is mounted to the DOM. It is often used to perform setup tasks such as initializing state or subscribing to external events."},{"id":245,"question":"What is the purpose of the componentWillReceiveProps method in React Native?","options":["To initialize state and bind event handlers","To render JSX elements","To update the component's state","To perform actions when the component receives new props"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"The componentWillReceiveProps method in React Native is called when the component receives new props from its parent component. It is often used to perform actions such as updating the component's state based on the new props."},{"id":246,"question":"What is the purpose of the componentDidCatch method in React Native?","options":["To initialize state and bind event handlers","To render JSX elements","To handle errors that occur during rendering","To update the component's state"],"correctAnswer":"3","explanation":"The componentDidCatch method in React Native is called when an error occurs during rendering, in any of the children of the component. It is used to handle errors gracefully and prevent them from crashing the entire application."},{"id":247,"question":"What is the purpose of the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate method in React Native?","options":["To initialize state and bind event handlers","To render JSX elements","To get a snapshot of the DOM before a component update","To update the component's state"],"correctAnswer":"3","explanation":"The getSnapshotBeforeUpdate method in React Native is called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are to be reflected in the DOM. It allows you to capture some information from the DOM before it is potentially changed."},{"id":248,"question":"What is the purpose of the componentDidUpdate method in React Native?","options":["To initialize state and bind event handlers","To render JSX elements","To perform actions after a component's props or state have changed","To update the component's state"],"correctAnswer":"3","explanation":"The componentDidUpdate method in React Native is called after the component's props or state have changed and the component has been re-rendered.
