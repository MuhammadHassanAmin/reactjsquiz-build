It provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to manually pass props down through each level."},{"id":217,"question":"How do you define a context in React Native?","options":["By using the createContext() function","By using the useState hook","By using the useEffect hook","By using the useContext hook"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"You define a context in React Native by using the createContext() function provided by React. This function creates a new context object that can be used to pass data to descendant components."},{"id":218,"question":"What is the purpose of the useContext hook in React Native?","options":["To manage local component state","To manage global application state","To handle navigation between screens","To manage user authentication"],"correctAnswer":"2","explanation":"The useContext hook in React Native is used to access the value of a context object that has been created using the Context API. It allows functional components to consume context values without needing to wrap them in a higher-order component."},{"id":219,"question":"What is Redux in React Native?","options":["A state management library","A navigation library","A styling library","A testing library"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"Redux is a state management library for React Native and other JavaScript frameworks. It provides a predictable state container that helps manage the state of an application in a consistent and scalable way."},{"id":220,"question":"What are the main principles of Redux?","options":["Single source of truth, Immutable state, Actions","Component state, Context API, Reducers","Mutation, Impure functions, Asynchronous actions","React Hooks, Functional components, JSX"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"The main principles of Redux include maintaining a single source of truth for the application state, ensuring that the state is immutable and cannot be directly mutated, and using actions to describe state changes."},{"id":221,"question":"How do you define actions in Redux?","options":["By using the createAction() function","By using the useState hook","By using the useEffect hook","By using the useContext hook"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"You define actions in Redux by using the createAction() function provided by the Redux toolkit. This function creates action objects that describe changes to the application state."},{"id":222,"question":"What is the purpose of reducers in Redux?","options":["To define the layout of the navigation bar","To manage local component state","To manage global application state","To handle navigation between screens"],"correctAnswer":"3","explanation":"Reducers in Redux are functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions dispatched to the store. They take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state object."},{"id":223,"question":"How do you define a reducer in Redux?","options":["By using the useState hook","By using the useEffect hook","By using the useReducer hook","By defining a function"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"You define a reducer in Redux by defining a function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state object. This function should be pure and deterministic, meaning it should not have side effects or rely on external factors."},{"id":224,"question":"What is the purpose of middleware in Redux?","options":["To define the layout of the navigation bar","To manage local component state","To manage global application state","To handle asynchronous actions and side effects"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"Middleware in Redux is a higher-order function that intercepts actions dispatched to the store before they reach the reducer. It can be used to perform asynchronous actions, side effects, logging, or other operations that are not directly related to state management."},{"id":225,"question":"What is the purpose of selectors in Redux?","options":["To define the layout of the navigation bar","To manage local component state","To manage global application state","To compute derived data from the state"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"Selectors in Redux are functions that compute derived data from the application state. They allow you to extract specific pieces of data from the state tree and perform complex transformations or calculations."},{"id":226,"question":"How do you define a selector in Redux?","options":["By using the useState hook","By using the useEffect hook","By using the useReducer hook","By defining a function"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"You define a selector in Redux by defining a function that takes the application state as an argument and returns the selected data. Selectors are typically used with libraries like Reselect to optimize performance by memoizing the results."},{"id":227,"question":"What is the purpose of immutability in Redux?","options":["To define the layout of the navigation bar","To manage local component state","To manage global application state","To ensure predictable state updates"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"Immutability in Redux refers to the practice of not directly mutating the application state. Instead, you create new state objects whenever a change is needed, ensuring that state updates are predictable and easier to reason about."},{"id":228,"question":"How do you ensure immutability in Redux?","options":["By using the useState hook","By using the useEffect hook","By using the useReducer hook","By creating new state objects"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"You ensure immutability in Redux by creating new state objects whenever a change is needed, rather than modifying the existing state directly. This can be achieved using techniques like object spread syntax or libraries like Immer."},{"id":229,"question":"What is the purpose of actions in Redux?","options":["To define the layout of the navigation bar","To manage local component state","To manage global application state","To describe state changes"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"Actions in Redux are plain JavaScript objects that describe state changes in the application. They have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed and may contain additional data payload."},{"id":230,"question":"How do you dispatch actions in Redux?","options":["By using the dispatch() function","By updating the state directly","By using HTML links","Dispatching actions is not supported in Redux"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"You dispatch actions in Redux by using the dispatch() function provided by the Redux store. This function takes an action object as an argument and dispatches it to the store, triggering the corresponding reducer to update the state."},{"id":231,"question":"What are the benefits of using Redux in React Native?","options":["Predictable state management, centralized data flow, time-travel debugging","Dynamic routing, automatic code splitting, fast rendering","Server-side rendering, tree shaking, progressive web app support","Client-side caching, lazy loading, pre-fetching"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"Redux offers several benefits for state management in React Native, including predictable state management, centralized data flow, and time-travel debugging.
