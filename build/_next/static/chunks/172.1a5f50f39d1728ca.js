This allows for better encapsulation and organization of component functionality."},{"id":"102","question":"Can the useImperativeHandle hook be used to expose methods to sibling components?","options":["Yes, it can expose methods to both parent and sibling components","No, it can only expose methods to parent components","It depends on the specific use case","Sibling components cannot access exposed methods"],"correctAnswer":"2","explanation":"No, the useImperativeHandle hook can only be used to expose methods to parent components. It is designed to facilitate communication between child and parent components, not between sibling components."},{"id":"103","question":"What is the impact of using the useImperativeHandle hook on component re-renders?","options":["It increases the number of component re-renders","It decreases the number of component re-renders","It has no impact on component re-renders","It depends on the specific methods exposed"],"correctAnswer":"3","explanation":"The useImperativeHandle hook has no direct impact on component re-renders.

However, the cleanup of effects within the component, if needed, should be handled using the cleanup function returned by useEffect."},{"id":"106","question":"What is the main difference between useImperativeHandle and useRef?","options":["UseImperativeHandle is for managing component state, while useRef is for referencing DOM elements","UseImperativeHandle is for exposing methods to parent components, while useRef is for creating mutable references","There is no difference between useImperativeHandle and useRef","UseImperativeHandle automatically updates the component state, while useRef requires manual updates"],"correctAnswer":"2","explanation":"The main difference between useImperativeHandle and useRef is that useImperativeHandle is for customizing the instance value exposed to parent components through refs, while useRef is for creating mutable references, primarily for referencing DOM elements."},{"id":"107","question":"Can the useImperativeHandle hook be used to expose methods from class components?","options":["Yes, it can expose methods from both functional and class components","No, it can only expose methods from functional components","It depends on the specific use case","Class components do not support method exposure"],"correctAnswer":"1","explanation":"The useImperativeHandle hook is specifically designed for functional components. However, class components have their own way to expose methods via refs, typically using React.forwardRef."},{"id":"108","question":"What is the primary use case for exposing methods using useImperativeHandle?","options":["To manage component state","To handle side effects","To communicate with child components","To enable parent components to control child components"],"correctAnswer":"4","explanation":"The primary use case for exposing methods using useImperativeHandle is to enable parent components to control child components imperatively.
