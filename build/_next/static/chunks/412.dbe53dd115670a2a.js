used to provide the context value to its descendants in the component tree."},{"id":"147","question":"How can you use the useContext hook in a class component?","options":["It is not possible to use useContext in a class component","Wrap the class component with a functional component that uses useContext","Use the this.context syntax","Extend the class from React.ContextComponent class"],"correctAnswer":"2","explanation":"To use the useContext hook in a class component, you can wrap the class component with a functional component that uses

component update phase","It is not related to the component lifecycle","It is called during the component unmounting phase"],"correctAnswer":"3","explanation":"The useContext hook is not directly related to the component lifecycle; it is used to consume a context value."},{"id":"149","question":"How can you share state logic between components using useContext?","options":["Use a global

components, you can define a context that holds the shared state."},{"id":"150","question":"In a context provider, how can you provide multiple values to different parts of the component tree?","options":["Create separate context providers for each value","Use the value prop with an object containing multiple values","Combine values into a single string and use it as the context value","Use the values prop with an array containing multiple values"],"correctAnswer":"2","explanation":"You can provide multiple values to different parts of the component tree using the value prop
